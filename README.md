# HTML `div` and Semantic Tags

## Intro

HTML semantic tags are a set of HTML elements that provide meaning and structure to the content of a web page. Semantic tags are used to describe the content of a web page and its relationship with other content on the page. They help search engines, screen readers, and other web technologies to understand the content of a page and improve its accessibility.

## Best Practices for Using Semantic Tags

When using semantic tags, it's important to follow these best practices:

- Use the appropriate tag for the content
  - Choose the right semantic tag that best describes the content you want to display.
- Use semantic tags consistently
  - Use the same semantic tags across your web pages to provide consistency and improve the accessibility of your website.
- Avoid using non-semantic tags for content
  - Use semantic tags instead of non-semantic tags like `<div>` and `<span>` for the content of your web page.
- Avoid using semantic tags for formatting
  - Don't use semantic tags for formatting purposes. Instead, use CSS to style your web page.

In conclusion, semantic tags are an essential tool for creating accessible, meaningful, and well-structured web pages.
